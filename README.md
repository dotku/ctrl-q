# ctrl-q
A program close the application by Ctrl+Q on windows

> Get AutoHotKey. Open Notepad and paste the following:

> ^q::Send !{F4}  
return  
Save it as an .ahk file, run it and try it out. If it works, stick it in your startup folder and you are good to go. The above code simply maps Ctrl + Q to Alt + F4.

> If you want it to be Alt + Q, then replace the ^ with a !

> If you can't get AutoHotKey, I've compiled the above script for you and uploaded it here
